this is the replacement to all raiding jobs in use.
status:
    partly broken. missing features

notes:
    nex has this integrated. i might need to inform them of any changes made so they can also change this job, depending on context

job name: replaced commodity
    raiding_marines:    marines

CURRENT OBJECTIVE:
i found a listener that does everything i want effortlessly. at long fucking last.
here is what im going to do:
    1)(DONE! (not save compatible)) remove the current marrine listiner, and subsatood it with my own.
        -com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.PlayerFleetPersonnelTracker -> reportRaidObjectivesAchieved(RaidResultData data, InteractionDialogAPI dialog, Map<String, MemoryAPI> memoryMap)
    2)(not started) add a system in crewReplacer_Job and crewReplacer_Crew to transfer all the relevant data over to crew, so i can get some sweet sweet XP for my units
    3)(not started) remove my current implementation of removeing crew. it is now -outdated-.

exstra data:
    regarding marrine XP, possible canteens for were / when that is calculated
        -com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.PlayerFleetPersonnelTracker
            -according to alex, the magnificent, this is were this is calculated, and gotten.
            -reportRaidObjectivesAchieved(RaidResultData data, InteractionDialogAPI dialog, Map<String, MemoryAPI> memoryMap)
                -for marine XP gain from data.
                -found in CrewReplacerMarketCMD line 1410.
                -see CURRENT OBJECTIVE for what im going to do.
            -doExtraConfirmActions()?
    line 1246: were i get and apply crew losses.
issues:
    1) XP for marines is not given right. it should be given based on battle difficulty * %of force that is marines, but its not right now.
    2) deployment. right now it is assumed, that you are deploying 100% of youe forces, even though that is not the way the game works.
    3) fails to add ground support modifiers to combat, even though it says it does?
        -cant find any evidence that this is true
        -the -display- for available ground crew does not display ground combat power on the conform page? maybe that is it?
    4) fails to adjust marries losses based on amount of available ground support
        -updated code.
solutions:
    1) add a new static variable to crewReplacerMarketCMD. it will record for every battle:
        1) battle difficulty
        2) number of deployed crew power
      then in marines crew class, run the code:
        marrineXP += (_[0] * (crewPowerUsed / _[1]));
      NOTE: other crew can also get this XP if they want to.
    2) find out were the game tracks deployment, and set it up so i only deploy the % of forces i actually deploy in combat.
