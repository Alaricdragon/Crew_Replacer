regarding normadicSurvival compatibility:
DOING RIGHT THIS VERY SECOND:
    i have in theory completed the compatibility patch. all thats left is some tests to conferm its all working.


issue found that needs to be fixed:
    1) the way i overwrite functions. i need to (when possable) find a way to use .super() in every one, for version combatability reasons.
        even if that means i need to undo changes sometimes, it might still be extremely useful..
        (examples were i should have done that: marketCMD, salvageCMD survey pluging exstra....)

    2) in CrewReplacer_normadicSurvivalA : checkCapacityLimitGetMaxNumber
        i need to use a more efficient method for getting the amount of batches i can store.



regarding survey job:
    POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
    1) get getConsumed() and getRequired()
        1) reduce crew/supplies/hevy matchenery cost by available crew replacer crew.
        2) add crew replacer crew of said jobs to costs in bouth functiions.
        3) if 2 crews have the same priority should the max required amount of said item?
        4) having this code runs set 'can xp crew replacer' boolean to true
        5) save the rqueired amount of items for getXP
    2) getXP(): THIS FUNCTION RUNS AFTER survey is completed.
        1) run crewReplacer automaticly get and apply crew losses for all functions.
        2) set can xp crew replacer boolean to false.

    im trying to find the position were the code is ran for this job, so i can mimic it. it does not exist in the place it should though.
    im going to try and get myself a new copy of starsector core next time i try to fight with this.
    i have a path in. my victory is now possible.


add all not yet added jobs from vanilla starsector into this mod.

Bugs:
    in getCargoSpaceRange in crewReplacer_Job:
        1) this set of code can cause issues with other sets of code, causeing a miscalculation were i think i need less cargo then i acsualy need at low amounts.
           cant just remove Math.min, because then it can get claim to use mush more cargo then it actually does.
            if(includeDefence){
                float tempbT =  tempb / Crew.getCrewDefence(cargo);
                tempb = Math.min(tempb,tempbT);
            }


create an new 'crew cost' custom job.
-an idea, or issue i have, is with crew cost. as it is now, players must make new code to be able to apply crew cost to there crew.,
 however, it should be simple to create an job in crewReplacer to do that. dont know if anyone will use it, but they dont have to if they dont want to.
 *Needs:
 -to be able to apply crew cost at the start of the momth, week, day, or always.
    -when applying the code over time, it should be able to know how mush cost an crew used, by calculating the advradge crew
     in your fleet of this type over that time.
    -should be able to apply any item as costs for the crew. for example, credits, food, supply, mettle, other crew, exstra.
    -should beagle to apply an by product to the crew cost? might be very easy if i allow crew to have negative cost.
