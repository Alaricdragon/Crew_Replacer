notes:
    (this is personal notes for me. hopefully i can repair this almost broken job at some point.)
    possible leads on the survey plugin
        -OpenCoreTab. both survey and found a colony use this. no clue how it works. mapping now...
            -function i think im looking for extends InteractionDialogAPI
            -found function name useing logs: named o0Oo.
                -scaned located: com.fs.starfarer.ui.newui.o0Oo
                -issues: failed to locate o0Oo. cant find it anywhere. might need a java decompiler
                -found location: in starsector-core (starfarer_obf.jar):
                    -com.fs.starfarer.campain.ui
                    -com.fs.starfarer.combat.ai.system
                    -com.fs.starfarer.coreui
                    -com.fs.starfarer.ui.impl
                    -com.fs.starfarer.ui.newui
                        -THIS IS INVISABLE WHY CANT I SEE IT!!!
                -data info:
extra data:
    none.
issues:
    1) its impossible to have code ran when you press the survey button (as far as i know)
    2) things added with crew replacer -cannot- be consumed, even when they should be
        -supply's are consumed as normal
    3) instead of counting towards the number of items you have, crew replacer instead reduces the cost of surveys

solutions:
    there are none. unless i find were the number used and the numbers you have are calculated.
