saturation bombardment:

stabilize cargo pods:

fuel ships

supply ships



crew ships, and crew personel jobs:
    I have organized a 4 step process to managing this.
    1) apply min / max crew modification, based on crew jobs.
        -status on making the stats work
            OMFG. this is stuped. its like there is no way to do this at fucking all.
            the ids keep changing or something. its rediculus. why even barther with that methood?
            maybe i can add tags onto the ships themselfs? that might be fucking easyer at this ponit in time, because o my fucking god tyuehadjbsahhasjdbasjsdj
        -this needs to update when:
            1) i add/remove/scrap/move a ship.
            2) when i modify a ship in any way.
            3) whenever i open/close my cargo
            4) whenever i move a item inside of my cargo in any way
    2) apply the hullmod that apply all modifications to the fleet to every ship when:
        -i add/remove a ship.
        -also make it make sure every ship has said mod, just in case.
    3) create a intill to show how mush min / max crew i have.
    4) create a way to display a ping when im over modded crew capacity
        -Global.getSector().addPing();?
    5) create a way to apply 'overincomberd' modifications to the fleet when im over modded crew capacity
    6) create a way for new 'crew' to have losses from combat (like normal crew)
