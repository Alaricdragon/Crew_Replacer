v0.4.2:
    save compatible with V0.4+
    fixes:
        fixed a bug that caused the player to lose 2X the marines from rading.
    changes:
        changed the name of CrewReplacerLog to CrewReplacer_Log to match the rest of my code.
    the following functions were added. they are now considered the primary form of said functions
        crewReplacer_Job:
            getAvailableCrewPower(CargoAPI cargo)
            getAvailableCrew(CargoAPI cargo)
            automaticlyGetDisplayAndApplyCrewLost(CargoAPI cargo,int crewPowerRequired, float crew_power_to_lose,TextPanelAPI text)
            automaticlyGetAndApplyCrewLost(CargoAPI cargo, int crewPowerRequired, float crew_power_to_lose)
            applyCrewLost(ArrayList<Float> crewLost,CargoAPI cargo)
            getCrewForJob(CargoAPI cargo, float crewPowerRequired)
            displayCrewAvailable(CargoAPI cargo,TextPanelAPI text)

        crewReplacer_Crew: the following function were added
            removeCrew(CargoAPI cargo,float CrewToLost)
            getCrewInFleet(CampaignFleetAPI fleet)
            getCrewPowerInFleet(CampaignFleetAPI fleet)

        the reason said functions were added, is because i realized that making a moder input a fleet just to get cargo is a pointless.
        the old functions (that are the same, just they get CampaignFleetAPI instead of CargoAPI) will remain. they will simply run the new functions from them, so no change to your code is required, unless you are overwriting parts of a crewReplacer_Job, or a crewReplacer_Crew

    prep work:
        started to prepare my code for a rework of large parts of the raid plugging, to fix many issues
        started to prepare my code for more improvements and customization to crewReplacer_Job and crewReplacer_Crew
v0.4.1
    save compatible with V0.4+
    polish
        -made the 'repair Coronal Hyper Shunt' jobs display respect crew replacer.
    improvements
        -added a way to use Starsector's fancy display rules thing with crew replacer jobs. its called CrewReplacer_showResCost.

    crewReplacer crew:
        added 3 more functions:
        -getDisplayName()
        -getCrewIcon()
        for use when you want to have a crew that is not a commodity, and dont want to rebuild the inter display to do it,
        you can now simply override both functions, and everything will work
        -getCrewPower()
        a better way to set a non static power for your crew.

    crewReplacer Job:
        added 1 more function:
        getCrewDisplayNames()
        (the old getCrewNames) gets the crew name stats (that double as a ID). not the display name
    debugging:
        added a option to display logs of everything crew replacer is doing, for debugging. turn it on/off in the config file.
    error handling:
        added a bunch of error handling. it will output tot he log when a issue is detected, and help prevent crashes.
