TO BE REMOVED. THIS IS THE WORST.

this is the supply demand class description. it has nothing to do with the rest of crew replacer:
objective:
the supply demand libary lets you compleatly change an markets supply and demand (or just of certen industrys.)
how it works:
    set up some supply demand changes, added whatever exseptions or requirements you want to them
        -(give them all an difrent name, or they will not apply right)
    set up an supply demand set. add all the supple demand changes to it.
        -(give this an name you can remember. if it mathces something elses name, it could be overwriten.)
    (optional) add you supply demand set to supply demand list, for ease of acses.
    put 'crewReplacer_SupplyDemandLists.getRuleSet("rulename").applyMarket(market,false);' into
        an markets conditions apply.
    put 'crewReplacer_SupplyDemandLists.getRuleSet("rulename").applyMarket(market,true);' into
        an markets conditions unapply
        -btw, if anyone knows an market condition that is always active, please tell me, so i dont need to do this every time...

    enjoy having markets with vastly different supply and demand changes.
