v0.4.1
    save compatible with V0.4+(i think)
    polish
        -made the 'repair Coronal Hyper Shunt' jobs display respect crew replacer.
    improvements
        -added a way to use Starsector's fancy display rules thing with crew replacer jobs.

    crewReplacer crew:
        added 2 more functions:
        -getDisplayName()
        -getCrewIcon()
        for use when you want to have a crew that is not a commodity, and dont want to rebuild the inter display to do it,
        you can now simply override both functions, and everything will work

    debugging:
        started on a debugger. not finished yet
