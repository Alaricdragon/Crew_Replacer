this is the replacement to all 'steal a starship' jobs in use.
status:
    functional

notes:
    put random data on jobs here

job name: replaced commodity
    Mission_hijack_marines:     marines

extra data:
    none.

issues:
    1) lack of feedback: there is no feedback on what crew are used for this job
    2) there is no way to have code ran when the job is ran

solutions:
    1) change and add some text to the mission to say what is being deployed.
    2) find out were the mission is 'confirmed' and run code there that shows what was deployed
