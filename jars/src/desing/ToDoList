regarding survey job:
    im trying to find the position were the code is ran for this job, so i can mimic it. it does not exist in the place it should though.
    im going to try and get myself a new copy of starsector core next time i try to fight with this.
    i have a path in. my victory is now possible.

add a 'defence' stat to all crew.
at this time, crew does not have a way to change how many crew are destroyed in a job when they loes things.
this will add a simple way to do that.
and will help with other things

remake the documentation, so people can use it again. it is outdated

add all not yet added jobs from vanilla starsector into this mod.


create an new 'crew cost' custom job.
-an idea, or issue i have, is with crew cost. as it is now, players must make new code to be able to apply crew cost to there crew.,
 however, it should be simple to create an job in crewReplacer to do that. dont know if anyone will use it, but they dont have to if they dont want to.
 *Needs:
 -to be able to apply crew cost at the start of the momth, week, day, or always.
    -when applying the code over time, it should be able to know how mush cost an crew used, by calculating the advradge crew
     in your fleet of this type over that time.
    -should be able to apply any item as costs for the crew. for example, credits, food, supply, mettle, other crew, exstra.
    -should beagle to apply an by product to the crew cost? might be very easy if i allow crew to have negative cost.
