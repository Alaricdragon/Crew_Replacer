issue found that needs to be fixed:
    1) the way i overwrite functions. i need to (when possable) find a way to use .super() in every one, for version combatability reasons.
        even if that means i need to undo changes sometimes, it might still be extremely useful..
        (examples were i should have done that: marketCMD, salvageCMD survey pluging exstra....)

    2) in CrewReplacer_normadicSurvivalA : checkCapacityLimitGetMaxNumber
        i need to use a more efficient method for getting the amount of batches i can store.

missing core jobs:
    crewShips
        -show on how mush crew you have in fleet.
        -allow min crew to be a things
        possable locations of things:
           CargoAPI: getCrew()
                -this is not a good idea. a lot of the code gets the commodity crew directly. so this would be difficult.
           shipAPI - getCurrentCR()
                -for changing the amount of crew on a ship and weather or not its fully crewed.
                -maybe also use something like a hidden hullmod on player ships that modifys the combat ready interface??
           Interface CampaignFleetAPI
                -forceSync()
                -setAIMode(boolean aiMode)
           https://fractalsoftworks.com/starfarer.api/com/fs/starfarer/api/campaign/listeners/FleetEventListener.html
                -maybe for crew losses and recovery after combat..????
            Interface FleetMemberAPI
                -might be something good here, i dont know =(
            Interface MutableFleetStatsAPI
                -im grasping at straw...
    fuelShips
        -FleetLogisticsAPI
            not mush here, but might be a good backup if i need to do to it what i did to the survey plugin.
    supplyShips
    use crew storage
           CargoAPI: getCrew()
                -this is not a good idea. a lot of the code gets the commodity crew directly. so this would be difficult.
                -PlayerFleetPersonnelTracker might be something in here.
    use fuel storage
           CargoAPI: getFuel()
                -this is not a good idea. a lot of the code gets the commodity crew directly. so this would be difficult.
                -on the other hand, it might be a very good idea if its only used in like one place.



regarding survey job:
    this works now. only one issue:
    getXP() from the survey plugging may cause supplys to drop. because thats were im running my code. this is a issue.

Bugs:
    survying causing items in cargo to go all mismatched. its so frustrating!!!!!
        -how it works (in theory):
            the code i have to remove all 'sohwdow crew' from invatory actavates sometimes, and when it does, it reorganizes the invatory a little bit. this is a issue because:
                IT LEAVES GHOSTS BEHIND!!! so the position of the items -looks- like it was at the location before it was removed, but they are actually not! this is so frustrating!
                -solutions: find a way to -force- showdo crew to be at the last tile of the cargo. or find a way to force the cargo to reorganize as it fucking should!!!

                -solutions:
                    1)(done) make it so shawdoCrew are last on every item list, so they get loaded as the last thing in cargo
                        -this seemed to help. its now mush harder to get this error.
                    2)(done) make it so surveying removes showdo crew as fast as possable, beofre the survey intell comes in
                        -this does nothing. at all. im going to keep it though.
                    4) make it so showdo crew when removed, slide every fucking item past it onto there currest positions.

                -issues:
                    -exspermentation shoed that the reason for my invatory sliding like it does comes from the fact i remove crew on 'remove icon'.
                     -this might be fixable if i can create a way to simply remove all showdo crew just after any calculation that requires it. so i need to use the icon trick less.
                      -i might beable to do this by setting up some type of tick based timer, that i can run that removes all showdos from the invatory provided you are currently NOT at the world you are trying to survey.
                      -if i could make this code run every X ticks, that would be so so so so so so mush better.
    in getCargoSpaceRange in crewReplacer_Job:
        1) this set of code can cause issues with other sets of code, causeing a miscalculation were i think i need less cargo then i acsualy need at low amounts.
           cant just remove Math.min, because then it can get claim to use mush more cargo then it actually does.
            if(includeDefence){
                float tempbT =  tempb / Crew.getCrewDefence(cargo);
                tempb = Math.min(tempb,tempbT);
            }


create an new 'crew cost' custom job.
-an idea, or issue i have, is with crew cost. as it is now, players must make new code to be able to apply crew cost to there crew.,
 however, it should be simple to create an job in crewReplacer to do that. dont know if anyone will use it, but they dont have to if they dont want to.
 *Needs:
 -to be able to apply crew cost at the start of the momth, week, day, or always.
    -when applying the code over time, it should be able to know how mush cost an crew used, by calculating the advradge crew
     in your fleet of this type over that time.
    -should be able to apply any item as costs for the crew. for example, credits, food, supply, mettle, other crew, exstra.
    -should beagle to apply an by product to the crew cost? might be very easy if i allow crew to have negative cost.
