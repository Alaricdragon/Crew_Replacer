this is the replacement to all survey jobs in use. for when you survey a world.

status:
    patchwork. barely functional.

job name: replaced commodity
    survey_crew:            crew
    survey_supply:          supply
    survey_heavyMachinery:  heavy_machinery


issues:
    1) its impossible to have code ran when you press the survey button (as far as i know)
    2) things added with crew replacer -cannot- be consumed, even when they should be
        -supply's are consumed as normal
    3) instead of counting towards the number of items you have, crew replacer instead reduces the cost of surveys

solutions:
    there are none. unless i find were the number used and the numbers you have are calculated.
