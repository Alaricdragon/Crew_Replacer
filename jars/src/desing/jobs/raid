this is the replacement to all raiding jobs in use.
status:
    functional. missing features

notes:
    deploys 100% of forces always.
    nex has this integrated. i must inform them of any changes made so they can also change this job.

job name: replaced commodity
    raiding_marines:    marines


issues:
    1) XP for marines is not given right. it should be given based on battle difficulty * %of force that is marines, but its not right now.
    2) deployment. right now it is assumed, that you are deploying 100% of youe forces, even though that is not the way the game works.
solutions:
    1) add a new static variable to crewReplacerMarketCMD. it will record for every battle:
        1) battle difficulty
        2) number of deployed crew power
      then in marines crew class, run the code:
        marrineXP += (_[0] * (crewPowerUsed / _[1]));
      NOTE: other crew can also get this XP if they want to.
    2) find out were the game tracks deployment, and set it up so i only deploy the % of forces i actually deploy in combat.
