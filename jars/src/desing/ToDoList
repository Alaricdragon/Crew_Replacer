regarding normadicSurvival compatibility:
DOING RIGHT THIS VERY SECOND:
    i am working on the survey job. see 'regarding survey job' for details.

issue found that needs to be fixed:
    1) the way i overwrite functions. i need to (when possable) find a way to use .super() in every one, for version combatability reasons.
        even if that means i need to undo changes sometimes, it might still be extremely useful..
        (examples were i should have done that: marketCMD, salvageCMD survey pluging exstra....)

    2) in CrewReplacer_normadicSurvivalA : checkCapacityLimitGetMaxNumber
        i need to use a more efficient method for getting the amount of batches i can store.



regarding survey job:
    my sollution worked. 100 % omg it worked. finaly im free..
    whats left to do:
        1) test and make sure everything works. need to make sure the crew is consumed right as well.
        2) copy the descriptions from the base commodity onto my new showdo crew. as right now they have no descriptions.
        3) update the documentation on survey plugging to say its finally completed.
        4) thats it. thats all its done what do i even do next!??
add all not yet added jobs from vanilla starsector into this mod.

Bugs:
    in getCargoSpaceRange in crewReplacer_Job:
        1) this set of code can cause issues with other sets of code, causeing a miscalculation were i think i need less cargo then i acsualy need at low amounts.
           cant just remove Math.min, because then it can get claim to use mush more cargo then it actually does.
            if(includeDefence){
                float tempbT =  tempb / Crew.getCrewDefence(cargo);
                tempb = Math.min(tempb,tempbT);
            }


create an new 'crew cost' custom job.
-an idea, or issue i have, is with crew cost. as it is now, players must make new code to be able to apply crew cost to there crew.,
 however, it should be simple to create an job in crewReplacer to do that. dont know if anyone will use it, but they dont have to if they dont want to.
 *Needs:
 -to be able to apply crew cost at the start of the momth, week, day, or always.
    -when applying the code over time, it should be able to know how mush cost an crew used, by calculating the advradge crew
     in your fleet of this type over that time.
    -should be able to apply any item as costs for the crew. for example, credits, food, supply, mettle, other crew, exstra.
    -should beagle to apply an by product to the crew cost? might be very easy if i allow crew to have negative cost.
