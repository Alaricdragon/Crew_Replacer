a few things to note:
anytime you want accuses to a crewReplacer_job, or crewReplacer_crewSet please do so from crewReplacer_Main.

crewReplacer_job should generally not have there functions overwritten, unless you wanna do something extremely strange.
you can do so, but I advice only doing so when you want to change how a crewReplacer_job behaves, not when you want to
do something strange with a crewReplacer_crew.

crewReplacer_crewSet has no functions, and only exists as a way to add crew across a large range of jobs easily. for example,
NOTE: i need to finish this class before i write down how to edit and change it. if you see this message, i forgot to rewrite this small part of the documentation. dm me or something plz.

crewReplacer_Crew should have any function you want overwritten. every single function in said class is designed with that in mind.
to that end, despite that its made for turning commodities into crew, crews can be modified to be anything,
provided you overwrite the right functions.

additional, crewReplacer_Crew should be added to jobs in onApplicationLoad(). if they are added after onApplicationLoad() is
ran, then you need to run crewReplacer_Main.organizePriority() or crewReplacer_Job.organizePriority()

if you are looking to do something simpler, like turn a commodity into a crew with non dynamic stats (like normal crew in game)
1) find the crewReplacer_job you want the crew to have, and call it with crewReplacer_Main.getJob("jobname");
2) run the function addNewCrew(String crew,float crewPower,float crewDefence,float crewPriority) from the crewReplacer_job.
    -crew = the commodity ID you want this crew to represent. this changes its image, name, what is removed when crew is
     lost, and what item is looked for when trying to find out how many of this crew you have.
    -crewPower = the strength of your crew. this is how good they are at the job you have given them. default is 1.
    -crewDefence = the defence of your crew. this is how good your crew is at surviving situations. default is 1.
    -crewPriority = the priority of your crew. when a crewReplacer_Job requests crew, it will request the ones with the best priority first. default is 10.
3) repeat 1 and 2 for every job you want your crew to be able to preform.
-) example of adding a crew to a job.:
    crewReplacer_Main.getJob("salvage_heavyMachinery").addNewCrew("heavy_machinery",1,1,10);
