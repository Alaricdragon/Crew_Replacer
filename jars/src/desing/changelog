v0.6:
    save compatible with V0.5+
    mod combatability:
        now fully compatible with normadicSurvival. feel free to mod in new crews for the -many- jobs available.
    changes:
        disabled most console logs be default
    new:
        added a bunch of new crew sets for all already created jobs. will improve on that latter.

        new functions:
            crewReplacer_Job:
                boolean hasCrew(String crew)

                boolean addCrewSet(String jobSet)
                boolean removeCrewSet(String jobSet)
                void applyCrewSets()
            crewReplacer_Main:
                crewReplacer_crewSet getCrewSet(String crewSet)
                boolean removeCrewSet(String crewSet)
                boolean addOrMergeCrewSet(crewReplacer_crewSet crewSet)
        new classes:
            crewReplacer_crewSet.
                -a 'crew set' represents a set of crews, that are all replaceing the same commodity in the base game.
                example: the commodity 'crew' is used in salvaging, surveying, and repairing hyper realys.
                adding a Crew to the crew set 'crew' would add that Crew to all jobs that replaced the commodity 'crew'.
    fixes:
        fixed a bug that might have been letting 'crew' steel starships? opps?
v0.5.2 (internal update):
    new (internal):
        built a system to make it at least not hell to add in compatibility patches to crew replacer.
    prep work (iternal):
        made preparations to add nomadic survival stuff to crew replacer. all that's left is the integration
v0.5.1:
    save compatible with V0.5+
    documentation:
        finished the main part of the documentation for now.
    fixes:
        fixed crew defence not being set right on initialization.
v0.5:
    should be save compatible with V0.4+.
    background work:
        raids and marines:
            raid plugin things. see fixes
        started to do battle with the survey code. its making ghost sounds at me.
    fixes:
        made it so crewReplacer_Job.displayCrewAvailable() does not display crew available if you have none of said type of crew.
        made it so marine XP only effects marines.
        changed the way marines are removed again. hopefully it works this time.
        made it so raids can comprehend the fact that you did not deploy every force you had

        enabled 'marketHostileRaidConfirmContSel', 'marketHostileRaidResultSel' in my rules.csv maybe fixing a crash on raid non market
        -NOTE: its possable this fix failed. if someone notices the game giving a null point exception when you raid objectives somehow, plz tell meplz tell me.
    new:
        added 6 new function to crewReplacer_Job:
            applyExtraDataToCrew();
            applyExtraDataToCrew(Object newData);
            applyExtraDataToCrewAndJob(Object newData);
            resetExtraDataToCrews();
            resetExtraDataToCrewsAndJob();

            public boolean addNewCrew(String crew,float crewPower,float crewDefence,float crewPriority)
        added 5 new function to crewReplacer_Crew:
            resetExtraData();
            setExtraData(Object newData);

            displayCrewAvailable(CargoAPI cargo, float numberOfItems, TextPanelAPI text)
            displayCrewLost(CargoAPI cargo, float numberOfItems, TextPanelAPI text)

            public float getCrewDefence(CargoAPI cargo)
        added a new variable to both crewReplacer_Crew and crewReplacer_Job:
            public Object ExtraData;

        added a new variable to crewReplacer_Crew:
            public float crewDefence = 1;
        explanation:
            sometimes, one wants to send / process some random data to crews or jobs. this was hard before, but now its simple.
            this is currently used in the raid plugin for marines to get XP. will be explained farther when i update the documentation
        explanation 2:
            displayCrewNumbers was a effective way to display crew, but it needed to be split into two for modability sake. something i forgot to do earlier.
        explanation 3:
            i find myself wanting to have differences between crew ability to do a job, and how many losses they receive and the weight of said losses. this is the best way i think.
    changes:
        marine in raiding:
            made it so the marine displays its XP and related bonuses on it, instead of on the inter ground combat force.
        file names:
            changed the 'crew' and 'marine' files to 'CrewReplacer_CrewType_crew' and 'CrewReplacer_CrewType_marine' resepctively
        job data handling:
            made it so crew use there defence when handling crew losses, not there power. should be no difference so long as power and defence are the same
        other:
            made 'static ArrayList<crewReplacer_Job> Jobs' in 'crewReplacer_Main' 'private'
v0.4.3:
    save compatible with V0.4+
    fixes:
        fixed a missing crewReplacerRefrence on line 1139 in CrewReplacerMarketCMD.getMarineLossesStat(List<GroundRaidObjectivePlugin> data), that was getting marrines instead of crew
    changes:
        changed how marines are removed from a fleet. should change nothing.
        changed two lines of dialog in the raid plugin, to hopefully avoid confusion between ground troops and ground support ability.
    changed the following functions:
        crewReplacer_Crew:
            DisplayedCrewNumbers(float,TextPanelAPI) -> DisplayedCrewNumbers(CargoAPI,float,TextPanelAPI)
            getDisplayName()                         -> getDisplayName(CargoAPI)
            getCrewIcon()                            -> getCrewIcon(CargoAPI)
            getCrewPower()                           -> getCrewPower(CargoAPI)
        crewReplacer_Job:
            getCrewLost(ArrayList<Float>,float)             -> getCrewLost(CargoAPI,ArrayList<Float>, float)
            getCrewDisplayNames()                           -> getCrewDisplayNames(CargoAPI cargo)
            displayCrewLost(ArrayList<Float>, TextPanelAPI) -> displayCrewLost(CargoAPI,ArrayList<Float>, TextPanelAPI)
        reasoning:
            it was difficult before to have more dynamic custom stats and names for crew.
            routing cargo through everything in crewReplacer_Crew (and by requirements, some things in crewReplacer_Job),
            a user will be able to get anything from fleet to faction to other things in cargo, allowing more interesting crew options.
        NOTICE: anybody that uses any of the changed functions should look into updating there code, as it is now outdated. sorry.
    more prep work on the raiding plugin. its confusing.
v0.4.2:
    save compatible with V0.4+
    fixes:
        fixed a bug that caused the player to lose 2X the marines from rading.
    changes:
        changed the name of CrewReplacerLog to CrewReplacer_Log to match the rest of my code.
    the following functions were added. they are now considered the primary form of said functions
        crewReplacer_Job:
            getAvailableCrewPower(CargoAPI cargo)
            getAvailableCrew(CargoAPI cargo)
            automaticlyGetDisplayAndApplyCrewLost(CargoAPI cargo,int crewPowerRequired, float crew_power_to_lose,TextPanelAPI text)
            automaticlyGetAndApplyCrewLost(CargoAPI cargo, int crewPowerRequired, float crew_power_to_lose)
            applyCrewLost(ArrayList<Float> crewLost,CargoAPI cargo)
            getCrewForJob(CargoAPI cargo, float crewPowerRequired)
            displayCrewAvailable(CargoAPI cargo,TextPanelAPI text)

        crewReplacer_Crew: the following function were added
            removeCrew(CargoAPI cargo,float CrewToLost)
            getCrewInFleet(CampaignFleetAPI fleet)
            getCrewPowerInFleet(CampaignFleetAPI fleet)

        the reason said functions were added, is because i realized that making a moder input a fleet just to get cargo is a pointless.
        the old functions (that are the same, just they get CampaignFleetAPI instead of CargoAPI) will remain. they will simply run the new functions from them, so no change to your code is required, unless you are overwriting parts of a crewReplacer_Job, or a crewReplacer_Crew

    prep work:
        started to prepare my code for a rework of large parts of the raid plugging, to fix many issues
        started to prepare my code for more improvements and customization to crewReplacer_Job and crewReplacer_Crew
v0.4.1
    save compatible with V0.4+
    polish
        -made the 'repair Coronal Hyper Shunt' jobs display respect crew replacer.
    improvements
        -added a way to use Starsector's fancy display rules thing with crew replacer jobs. its called CrewReplacer_showResCost.

    crewReplacer crew:
        added 3 more functions:
        -getDisplayName()
        -getCrewIcon()
        for use when you want to have a crew that is not a commodity, and dont want to rebuild the inter display to do it,
        you can now simply override both functions, and everything will work
        -getCrewPower()
        a better way to set a non static power for your crew.

    crewReplacer Job:
        added 1 more function:
        getCrewDisplayNames()
        (the old getCrewNames) gets the crew name stats (that double as a ID). not the display name
    debugging:
        added a option to display logs of everything crew replacer is doing, for debugging. turn it on/off in the config file.
    error handling:
        added a bunch of error handling. it will output tot he log when a issue is detected, and help prevent crashes.
V0.4
    -new jobs:
        task: steal a starship mission
            job name:                               replaces
            Mission_hijack_marines:                 marines
        task: repair Coronal HyperShunt
            job name:                               replaces
            CoronalHyperShunt_repair_Metals:        metals
            CoronalHyperShunt_repair_RareMetals:    rare_metals
            CoronalHyperShunt_repair_Crew:          crew
    -issues:
        steal a starship mission has no feedback on what crews can do a mission. will be fixed later
        repair Coronal HyperShunt's fancy looking display that shows what is available/required dose not respect crew replacer yet. will be fixed in a week or so

V0.3.4
    -fixes:
        fixed supplyDemandChange crashing the game because of bad code when supply change was ran.
