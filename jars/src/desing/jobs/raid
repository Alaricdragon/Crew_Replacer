this is the replacement to all raiding jobs in use.
status:
    partly broken. missing features

notes:
    nex has this integrated. i might need to inform them of any changes made so they can also change this job, depending on context

job name: replaced commodity
    raiding_marines:    marines

CURRENT OBJECTIVE:
i found a listener that does everything i want effortlessly. at long fucking last.
here is what im going to do:
    1)(DONE! (not save compatible)) remove the current marrine listiner, and subsatood it with my own.
        -com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.PlayerFleetPersonnelTracker -> reportRaidObjectivesAchieved(RaidResultData data, InteractionDialogAPI dialog, Map<String, MemoryAPI> memoryMap)
    2)(done) add a system in crewReplacer_Job and crewReplacer_Crew to transfer all the relevant data over to crew, so i can get some sweet sweet XP for my units
    3)(done) remove my current implementation of removing crew in this job. it is now -outdated-.
    4)(done) actually add XP to marines as i use them.
    5)(done) remove the global crew power bonus marine XP gives ground troops.
        -was from playerFleet.getStats().getDynamic().getMod(Stats.PLANETARY_OPERATIONS_MOD). removed now? need to test
        -HERE testing stated. issues: currently, after my first opping the marrine raid screan with ariens with XP, it will permently remove the marrine XP modifier from the game.
            i dont know why, but this is a bug i cant let stand.
            -fixed it. was a issue with the marine class.
    6) remove the global crew loss bonus marine XP gives ground troops.
        -playerFleet.getStats().getDynamic().getMod(Stats.PLANETARY_OPERATIONS_MOD);?
    7) re-add the attack bonus to marines, complete with a display.
    8) re-add the marine loss bonus, no display needed? i don't know.
exstra data:
    regarding marrine XP, possible canteens for were / when that is calculated
        -com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.PlayerFleetPersonnelTracker
            -according to alex, the magnificent, this is were this is calculated, and gotten.
            -reportRaidObjectivesAchieved(RaidResultData data, InteractionDialogAPI dialog, Map<String, MemoryAPI> memoryMap)
                -for marine XP gain from data.
                -found in CrewReplacerMarketCMD line 1410.
                -see CURRENT OBJECTIVE for what im going to do.
            -doExtraConfirmActions()?
    line 1246: were i get and apply crew losses.
        -outdated. i now do so from the CrewReplacer_PlayerFleetPersonnelTracker.
issues:
    1) XP for marines is not given right. it should be given based on battle difficulty * %of force that is marines, but its not right now.
        -all XP additions have been removed. will add them soon.
    2) deployment. right now it is assumed, that you are deploying 100% of youe forces, even though that is not the way the game works.
        -untested fix. in the CrewReplacer_PlayerFleetPersonnelTracker
    3) fails to add ground support modifiers to combat, even though it says it does?
        -cant find any evidence that this is true
        -the -display- for available ground crew does not display ground combat power on the conform page? maybe that is it?
    4) fails to adjust marries losses based on amount of available ground support
        -updated code.
    5) issue were marrines with XP could cause -issues-
        -fixed. was because of a power *= power multi in code, slowly raising power to infinity and braking things.
    6) possable crash when the code tries to run raid non market
        -nex develuper said his mod might be overrideing this function.
        -nex develuper said it might have something to do with me failing to get the relevant data to my mod

solutions:
    1) add a new static variable to crewReplacerMarketCMD. it will record for every battle:
        1) battle difficulty
        2) number of deployed crew power
      then in marines crew class, run the code:
        marrineXP += (_[0] * (crewPowerUsed / _[1]));
      NOTE: other crew can also get this XP if they want to.
    2) find out were the game tracks deployment, and set it up so i only deploy the % of forces i actually deploy in combat.
