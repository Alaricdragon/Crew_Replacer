v0.4.1
    save compatible with V0.4+
    polish
        -made the 'repair Coronal Hyper Shunt' jobs display respect crew replacer.
    improvements
        -added a way to use Starsector's fancy display rules thing with crew replacer jobs. its called CrewReplacer_showResCost.

    crewReplacer crew:
        added 3 more functions:
        -getDisplayName()
        -getCrewIcon()
        for use when you want to have a crew that is not a commodity, and dont want to rebuild the inter display to do it,
        you can now simply override both functions, and everything will work
        -getCrewPower()
        a better way to set a non static power for your crew.

    crewReplacer Job:
        added 1 more function:
        getCrewDisplayNames()
        (the old getCrewNames) gets the crew name stats (that double as a ID). not the display name
    debugging:
        added a option to display logs of everything crew replacer is doing, for debugging. turn it on/off in the config file.
    error handling:
        added a bunch of error handling. it will output tot he log when a issue is detected, and help prevent crashes.
