crewReplacer_Main.getCrewSet(name+"_"+"crew").addNewCrew("AIretrofit_WorkerDrone",1,9);
improvements that must be made:
1)(DONE) look into classes that i have replaced, and -TRY- to get them to extend the classes they are replacing
   if exstension is impossable (do to private methods or information) copy the old class, but make everything protected. then exstend that.
   notes:
        the rules for changed to the base plugins are: (for replacement pluggin)
        copy the 'base' class
        run s/private/protected/g on it.
        make the replacement class exsend the new replaced class.
   (DONE)status:
        need to check:
            (DONE)
        need a replacement pluggin:
            (done. partial testing seems clear)crew_replacer_SalvageEntity
            (done. untested)surveypluggin. (colonize and salvage)
        can exstend:
            (done. tested. had this for like a year and forgot i made the change)CrewReplacerMarketCMD

        ponitless (nothing to exstend):
            steel a starship.
            hyper really repair.
2)(done) update all strings and put them into the config. this will help A LOT. with both editing, and people who want this mod in other languages
    theory: its possible that i might require to use a diffrent file at some ponit in the future to hold all the strings. so i have a plan. the best plan even:
    create a class that handles strings. i can them simply call the calss name, and the 'line id' to get the string i want, then solve for the string from there.
    NOTE: the reason i want shit to be displayed is so others can view it. personal logs, like the debug logs for the market CMD (not the error logs) should not be added to the settings.
    to do:


        find and replace all other strings i ever created. (NOTE: this should only be done for strings that display for the player, or are used as a main log for a modder to know what the flip is even going on.)
    done(primary display texts):
        crewReplacer_CrewSet
        crewReplacer_Job
        crewReplacer_Main
        crew_replacer_SalvageEntity(NEED TO TEST THIS AND MAKE SURE THINGS ARE DISPLAYING RIGHT!!!)(partial testing complete. need to test ruins and losing units.)
        crew_replacer_SalvageEntity_Base(NEED TO TEST THIS AND MAKE SURE ITS DISPLAYING THINGS RIGHT!!!)(no testing complete)
        CrewReplacer_SurveyPluginImpl_Base
        CrewReplacerMarketCMD(OMG THERE IS SO MANY STRINGS IM ALMOST SCARED TO TEST IT BUT I NEED TO AT SOME POINT)
        CrewReplacer_CrewType_marine
    done(debug text):
        crewReplacer_CrewSet
        crewReplacer_Job
        crewReplacer_Main
        crew_replacer_SalvageEntity
        crew_replacer_SalvageEntity_Base
        CrewReplacer_SurveyPluginImpl_Base
        (not doing. becuase i dont see a reason to. debugs for meeeee)CrewReplacer_CrewType_marine
    no strings to replace:
        crewReplacer_Crew

testing:
    (done)makue sure the the salvage on runins and worlds works.
        -(YES IT DOES)make sure 'without crew replacer' salvaging also shows all the -zero percent- modifyers. just in case.

    (done)make sure that everything to do with raiding works.
    (done)make sure surveying has no 'issues'


issue found that needs to be fixed:
    1) in CrewReplacer_normadicSurvivalA : checkCapacityLimitGetMaxNumber
        i need to use a more efficient method for getting the amount of batches i can store.

ask people to add crewReplacer support to there mods.
i know of a few mods that i would like to add crew replacer support to, but i need to ask:
1) if they are willing to do so them selfs (and offer to guied them though the process)
2) if they are willing to let me attempt to add a built in combatability patch if they are not (inform them that it might be impossable)
3)

hello fellow starsector moder. I was wondering if you would be interested in adding crew replacer support to your mod.

sorry if this is a bit rude of me to ask, but im going to ask anyways, so i apologize in advance.
so would you be willing to add support for my mod (crew replacer) to your mod? (or baring that, let me attempt to make a in built compatibility patch in crew replacer for your mod? that wont work most the time, granted, but it would work -sometimes-. so the offer for me to try that is there, provided you give permission)

so first thing first: what is crew replacer, and why would you want or need to support it? crew replacer is a mod with the objective of replacing every instance were a 'commodity' is called on by the game, with a special list that's basically (this is oversimplified), a list of commodity's that can act as whatever instance of commodity said list is replacing. this effectively lets moders add there own commodity's to act as the replaced commodity in game. this also fixes a mod compatibility issue, but letting as many commodity act as this items as one wants, over as many mods as one might want. if that makes sense.

as for why you would want to support it with your mod? simple: doing so lets other modders add items that can be used in a thing you made. as a example:
---INSERT EXAMPLE WITH SOMETHING SAID MODER HAS HERE. THIS IS IMPORTANT. DON'T FORGET TO DO THIS PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF SOMETHING---
until lets say 3 modders want to do something like this, with there own commodity's. then it quickly becomes a mess. but if one were to use crew replacer, as many people as wanted to could add there own commodity's to this instance, without even bugging you to mush. and very very easily. (its one line of code to add a crew).
the possible instances of commodity's being used in your mod(that i know of) that i would like to replace are:

there might be others that i don't know about, or simply think are low priority. but literally any item you use a commodity from the players cargo bay, is a time crew replacer can be involved. i don't know your mod like you do, but would be happy to talk about and help you work out how to add said things easily and cleanly.

please contact me if you are interested and i will walk you though the steps of making your mod have this support. if you want your mod to not require crew replacer to function, i can walk you though how to make it so its not required well still having said compatibility. if you simply dont want to/ dont want me to build a compatibility patch, i understand, but please reply with a -no- anyway, so i can see were people stand on this topic.

link to my mod:[url=https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=24249.0]crew replacer[/url]

known mods with possable crew:
(said they would look into it.)Nexerlin: invasions(done), found a outpost station thing?
(said i could make my own branch then request to merge)terraforming and station construction: station construction
(said i could maky my own patch. said they cant work on there mod now.)Forge Production: getting into a dominion era moma ship.
(said not now. currently doing a rework of systems)ashes of the domion: repairing a cryosleeper
(said sure, why not. although they wont help, they are busy.)Xan empire: the specal ships with the organic ship forge.
unknown (possibly industrial evolution?): 'removing' a ruin.
unknown: 'exsploring' a station. required both crew and marines.
unknwon: random destress call that wanted mariens and crew to exsplor a ship. but i dont know what mod that is from.

missing core jobs:
    (mostly done)found a market:
        founding a market code -is- possable. i know this because i have done so in market retrofits. i would simply need to
        create a system like that but for here. although i could also cheat and just use market retrofits, but that is... rude.
        so what do i need to do?
        1) swap the demand of create a outpost with showdow crew demand.
        2) create a colonly founding interface (its called sometihng else check market retrofit).
        3) give this interface the same 'determin if the player is at this world' that market retrofits has.
        4) set it to simply remove the wanted to be removed items every time a player founds a market.
        5) set it to not be instaled provided marketRetrofits is inabled.
        6) create a new market founder in market retorfits to replcer the deaflt one.

    crewShips
        -show on how mush crew you have in fleet.
        -allow min crew to be a things
        possable locations of things:
           CargoAPI: getCrew()
                -this is not a good idea. a lot of the code gets the commodity crew directly. so this would be difficult.
           shipAPI - getCurrentCR()
                -for changing the amount of crew on a ship and weather or not its fully crewed.
                -maybe also use something like a hidden hullmod on player ships that modifys the combat ready interface??
           Interface CampaignFleetAPI
                -forceSync()
                -setAIMode(boolean aiMode)
           https://fractalsoftworks.com/starfarer.api/com/fs/starfarer/api/campaign/listeners/FleetEventListener.html
                -maybe for crew losses and recovery after combat..????
            Interface FleetMemberAPI
                -might be something good here, i dont know =(
            Interface MutableFleetStatsAPI
                -im grasping at straw...
    fuelShips
        -FleetLogisticsAPI
            not mush here, but might be a good backup if i need to do to it what i did to the survey plugin. or to the old survey plugin.
    supplyShips
    use crew storage
           CargoAPI: getCrew()
                -this is not a good idea. a lot of the code gets the commodity crew directly. so this would be difficult.
                -PlayerFleetPersonnelTracker might be something in here.
    use fuel storage
           CargoAPI: getFuel()
                -this is not a good idea. a lot of the code gets the commodity crew directly. so this would be difficult.
                -on the other hand, it might be a very good idea if its only used in like one place.



regarding survey job:
    this works now. only one issue:
    getXP() from the survey plugging may cause supplys to drop. because thats were im running my code. this is a issue.

Bugs:
    in getCargoSpaceRange in crewReplacer_Job:
        1) this set of code can cause issues with other sets of code, causeing a miscalculation were i think i need less cargo then i acsualy need at low amounts.
           cant just remove Math.min, because then it can get claim to use mush more cargo then it actually does.
            if(includeDefence){
                float tempbT =  tempb / Crew.getCrewDefence(cargo);
                tempb = Math.min(tempb,tempbT);
            }


create an new 'crew cost' custom job.
-an idea, or issue i have, is with crew cost. as it is now, players must make new code to be able to apply crew cost to there crew.,
 however, it should be simple to create an job in crewReplacer to do that. dont know if anyone will use it, but they dont have to if they dont want to.
 *Needs:
 -to be able to apply crew cost at the start of the momth, week, day, or always.
    -when applying the code over time, it should be able to know how mush cost an crew used, by calculating the advradge crew
     in your fleet of this type over that time.
    -should be able to apply any item as costs for the crew. for example, credits, food, supply, mettle, other crew, exstra.
    -should beagle to apply an by product to the crew cost? might be very easy if i allow crew to have negative cost.
