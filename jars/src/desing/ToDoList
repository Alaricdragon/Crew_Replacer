add in logs all over the mod.
    to add logs to:
        crewReplacer_crew
        crewReplacer_Job

    already added logs to:
        crewReplacer_Main
        crewReplacer_showResCost

    IDEA:
        add a function to add a "   " to the display. this will let me indent easier, especially when things loop
        todo:
            1: add a new class for logs.
            2: add 2 new functions, push and pop, to remove/add new indents.
            3: store indent status. increase / decrease indents at will. set max indents to a number



add all not yet added jobs from vanilla starsector into this mod.


create an new 'crew cost' custom job.
-an idea, or issue i have, is with crew cost. as it is now, players must make new code to be able to apply crew cost to there crew.,
 however, it should be simple to create an job in crewReplacer to do that. dont know if anyone will use it, but they dont have to if they dont want to.
 *Needs:
 -to beable to apply crew cost at the start of the momth, week, day, or always.
    -when applying the code over time, it should be able to know how mush cost an crew used, by calculating the advradge crew
     in your fleet of this type over that time.
    -should be able to apply any item as costs for the crew. for example, credits, food, supply, mettle, other crew, exstra.
    -should beagle to apply an by product to the crew cost? might be very easy if i allow crew to have negative cost.
