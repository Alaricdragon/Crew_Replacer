    survey_supply:          supply
    survey_heavyMachinery:  heavy_machinery

notes:
    this job used to have... issues. for all the worst reasons. now it.. works. completely. hopefully.
extra data:
    none.
issues:
    1) when running getXP(), this attempts to remove items as needed by the survey_supply job from the player inventory. i do hope there is litterly no instance of that happing or im going to need to find a new solution...
solutions:
    find a better place to put the 'calculate cargo loss' code for surveying. maybe something in the rules CSV?
